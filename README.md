# Autonomous Driving using SLAM

This is my final capstone project, an autonomous driving car using SLAM.

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to learn about the different components that make up a self driving car stack.

The modules implemented in this project are:

1. Sensor interfaces with camera, depth and IMU data.
2. Perception system including lane detection and object detection.
3. Planning system to control the cars behaviour.
4. Control system to effectively move the car.
5. Simulation using CARLA and Simulink.
